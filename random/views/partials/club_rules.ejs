            <h3>📊 How Do Points Work?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Play a game</strong> = Earn points based on your rank</li>
                <li><strong>Skip a game</strong> = Get 0 points (no penalty!)</li>
                <li>Points are calculated for each game you play</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>🎯 Points Calculation</h3>
            <p>When you play a game, your points are:</p>
            <p class="formula"><strong>Points = Number of Players - Your Rank + 1</strong></p>
            <p>The better you rank, the more points you earn!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>🏅 Final Score = Total Points</h3>
            <p>Your total points from all games are added up. Players are ranked from <strong>highest points (best)</strong> to <strong>lowest points</strong>. More points = better ranking!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>💡 Example Scenarios:</h3>
            <ul class="scenarios">

                <li>Come 5th out of 10 = 10 - 5 + 1 = 6 points</li>
                <li>Come last (10th) out of 10 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1 point</li>
                <li>Don't play = 0 points (no penalty)</li>
