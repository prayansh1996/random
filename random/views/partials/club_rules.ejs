    <div class="rules-content">
        <p class="intro">Welcome to our Game Club leaderboard! Every week, we track who's showing up, playing hard, and climbing the ranks. Here's how your weekly standing is calculated. It's fair, fun, and keeps everyone motivated—even if you miss a day!</p>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>📊 How Do Weekly Ranks Work?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All players who play at least once</strong> in the week are included in the weekly ranking.</li>
                <li>Each day, if you play, we add your <strong>actual rank</strong> (1st, 2nd, etc.) to your weekly score.</li>
                <li>If you <strong>don't play</strong> on a day, a <strong>penalty score</strong> is added instead. 😬</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>❌ What's the Penalty for Missing a Day?</h3>
            <p>If you skip a day, your penalty is equal to:</p>
            <p class="formula"><strong>Number of players who played that day + 1</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>🧮 Final Score = Total of All Ranks + Penalties</h3>
            <p>The lower your total, the higher you rank! At the end of the week, everyone is sorted from the <strong>lowest score (best)</strong> to the <strong>highest (needs a comeback 😉)</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>💡 Some Fun Scenarios:</h3>
            <ul class="scenarios">
                <li>You play and win = 🥇 1 point</li>
                <li>You come 5th out of 6 = 5 points</li>
                <li>You don't play and 6 others do = 7 points</li>
                <li>You play all week = No penalties = You legend 🏅</li>
            </ul>
